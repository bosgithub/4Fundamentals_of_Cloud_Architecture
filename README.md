# Fundamentals_of_Cloud_Architecture

## What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of technology services, including compute, storage, database, networking, software, and more. This is done over the internet with pay as you go pricing.

### Example of Cloud Computing:
Let's say we run a company called AIBOotcamp that provide AI/ML lesson over the internet, learners can navigate through our site to take courses on different AI subjects. As AIBOotcamp gets more popular, more people come on our site to take courses, traffic increases. With unanticipated increased traffic, there can be problems. If our equipment can't keep up with the demand, our services will slows down, which might cause learners to stop using our service. A way to prevent this from happening is to buy or rent new servers to handle the newly increased traffic without slowing down the website. It will take time to set them up and will cost money. Even though we won't need these servers all the time, only during peak times of the week, but we will still pay for them all the time.

The other option is to use cloud computing. This time, we put our website on a cloud server, we can access this server remotely. We'll now have access to computing power instantly when we need it. As more people start visiting our website, and we need more power to scale up, we can access more computing power in the cloud, as we need, on-demand. If our website traffic comes back down, we can easily release those servers back to the cloud.
Billing works similar to how we pay for electricity or gas. When we use the cloud service, the meter starts running, and when we're done we turn it off and the meter stops.

## Cloud computing vs. on-premise
Cloud is more scalable as we can easily add or release cloud resources. It also has a fast set-up speed. Lastly, the billing is more flexible in the cloud since we only pay for what we use.

There are situations in which an on-premise server is cheaper or possibly more secure. You can do more with the cloud than host a website on a server. You could store, back up, and recover data, create cloud-native applications, stream audio and video, deliver software on demand, analyze data, embed artificial intelligence models, and much more.


## Cloud Serivces:
Compute: provide the brains to process the workload

Storage: save and store data

Database: store more structured sets of data

## Characteristics of cloud computing
Virtualization: Fundamental technology that powers cloud computing, it splits physical servers into multiple virtual servers each runing independently. This maximizes the ouput of individual servers



Scalability: Ease to add and remove resources as you need them

Vertical scaling: Increase the power of the instance
Horizontal scaling: Increase number of instance




cost: pay for what you use, no capital cost and pay as you go


speed: Fast set up time and on demand resource


performance: Access to fast and efficient computing resources, there are data centers which house an organization's IT operations and equipments. Cloud give fast computer hardwares access to worldwide network of data centers 

growth: Cloud grow using a wide range of resources and services

reliability: Guaranteed durability and availability of data and services, duplication of data accross data centers and availability is ensured even in cases of natural disasters

security: secure storage and management of data, risky to trust 3rd party with your own data.

### Cloud Service Models:

in terms of the car analogy.

[Networking, Storage, Servers, Virtualization, O/S, Middleware, Runtime, Data, Applications]

On Premise:

For the on-premise approach. We are responsible for everything; the car, maintenance, insurance, cleaning, parking, fuel, driving, and finding a route

[Networking, Storage, Servers, Virtualization, O/S, Middleware, Runtime, Data, Applications]

***Infrastructure as a service(Iaas):***

Cloud based alternative to on-premise infrastructure, the main advantages are scalable alternative to expensive on premise infrastructure. The users are system admins, and some examples are cloud servers from Google compute engine, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services

*Below are what's required for a typical Iaas*

[~~Networking, Storage, Servers, Virtualization,~~ O/S, Middleware, Runtime, Data, Applications]

***Platform as a service(PaaS):***

Hardware and software tools over the internet used to develop applications, the main advantages are that the developers don't need to start from scratch when creating applications. The main users are developers and examples of Paas are web apps, logic apps such as google app engine, windows azure, aws elastic beanstalk

*Below are what's required for a typical Paas*
