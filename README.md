## What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of technology services, including compute, storage, database, networking, software, and more. This is done over the internet with pay as you go pricing.

### Example of Cloud Computing:
Let's say we run a company called AIBOotcamp that provide AI/ML lesson over the internet, learners can navigate through our site to take courses on different AI subjects. As AIBOotcamp gets more popular, more people come on our site to take courses, traffic increases. With unanticipated increased traffic, there can be problems. Our equipment can't keep up with the demand, and the service slows down, which might cause learners to stop using our learning site.
